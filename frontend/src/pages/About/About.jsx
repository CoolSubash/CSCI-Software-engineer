        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          CozyHome started as a dream in the heart of Orangeburg, South Carolina. 
          Five lifelong friends ‚Äî Kamara, Caleb, Subash, Kameron, and Justin ‚Äî shared one simple belief: 
          <strong> everyone deserves a place they feel proud to call home. </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Sitting around an old wooden table one warm evening, we talked about how difficult 
          it was to find affordable, stylish, and quality home products in smaller towns like ours. 
          That night, CozyHome was born ‚Äî not just as a business, but as a mission to bring warmth, 
          joy, and beauty into everyday lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, CozyHome is more than a store. It's a community of dreamers, homemakers, 
          and creators who believe that the little things ‚Äî a cozy chair, a warm lamp, a colorful rug ‚Äî 
          make a world of difference.
